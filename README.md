### Conceptual Model

[Conceptual Model Lucid Chart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/728904b6-3eac-41ee-9c80-cc89d811dc4c/edit?viewport_loc=-449%2C-71%2C3131%2C1496%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_bc674f57-3cb0-483b-8c06-247711741271)

## Division of works and tasks

### Both team members collaborated and contributed evenly on the design and implementation of the database with MongoDB, LucidChart, and Google Suite

### [Michael Chang](https://github.com/michaelchang106) created the CRUD Operations and interface for Games table and developed the 5-6 queries on the Games Collection.

### [Daniel Lisko](https://github.com/djlisko01) created the CRUD Operations and interface for Players table (and inherently Employees) and developed the 5-6 queries on the Employees Collection.

## Execution of project

- Download the code to your preferred directory
- Open that directory with your preferred terminal
- type "npm install" and hit enter

### Load Database and data with mongorestore / mongodump & start node-express server
- [follow guide to install mongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/)
- TLDR:
  - "brew tap mongodb/brew"
  - "brew install mongodb-community@5.0" 
  - "brew services start mongodb-community@5.0"
- type "npm start" and hit enter
  - mongoDB data should be restored using "mongorestore", if failed, type "mongorestore" manually in terminal

### Demonstrative queries against the mongoDB
- Michael's 5-6 mongo queries will run into the terminal. can read results in terminal and browse code located [in the databse folder](./database/nbaDBMongoQueries.js)
  - queries should run automatically, if not type "npm run michaelQueries", can type manually if you want to see the output again"
- Daniel's 5-6 mongo queries will run into the terminal. can read results in terminal and browse code located [in the databse folder](./database/dbQuery.js)
  - queries should run automatically, if not type "npm run danielQueries", can type manually if you want to see the output again"

### User interface to perform CRUD operations on the mongoDB
- navigate to "http://localhost:3000/" in your preferred browser
- use our developed interface to perform CRUD operations on the Employees -> Players & Coaches, and Games Tables
